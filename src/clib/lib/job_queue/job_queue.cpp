/*

   The running of external jobs is handled through an abstract
   job_queue implemented in this file; the job_queue then contains a
   'driver' which actually runs the job. All drivers must support the
   following functions

     submit: This will submit a job, and return a pointer to a
             newly allocated queue_job instance.

     clean:  This will clear up all resources used by the job.

     abort:  This will stop the job, and then call clean.

     status: This will get the status of the job.


   When calling the various driver functions the queue layer needs to
   dereference the driver structures, i.e. to get access to the
   driver->submit_jobs function. This is currently (rather clumsily??
   implemented like this):

        When implementing a driver the driver struct MUST start like
        this:

        struct some_driver {
            QUEUE_DRIVER_FUNCTIONS
            ....
            ....
        }

        The function allocating a driver instance will just return a
        (void *) however in the queue layer the driver is stored as a
        queue_driver_type instance which is a struct like this:

        struct queue_driver_struct {
            QUEUE_DRIVER_FIELDS
        }

        I.e. it only contains the pointers common to all the driver
        implementations. When calling a driver function the spesific
        driver will cast to it's datatype.

   Observe that this library also contains the files ext_joblist and
   ext_job, those files implement a particular way of dispatching
   external jobs in a series; AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED. So seen
   from the this scope those files do not provide any particluar
   functionality; there is no compile-time dependencies either.

/*
  Some words about status
  =======================

  The status of a particular job is given by the job_status field of
  the job_queue_node_type, the possible values are given by the enum
  job_status_type, defined in queue_driver.h.

  To actually __GET__ the status of a job we use the driver->status()
  function which will invoke a driver specific function and return the
  new status.

    1. The driver->status() function is invoked by the
       job_queue_update_status() function. This should be invoked by
       the same thread as is running the main queue management in
       job_queue_run_jobs().


    2. The actual change of status is handled by the function
       job_queue_change_node_status(); arbitrary assignments of the
       type job->status = new_status is STRICTLY ILLEGAL.


    3. When external functions query about the status of a particular
       job they get the status value currently stored (i.e. cached) in
       the job_node; external scope can NOT initiate a
       driver->status() function call.

       This might result in external scope getting a outdated status -
       live with it.


    4. The name 'status' indicates that this is read-only property;
       that is actually not the case. In the main manager function
       job_queue_run_jobs() action is taken based on the value of the
       status field, and to initiate certain action on jobs the queue
       system (and also external scope) can explicitly set the status
       of a job (by using the job_queue_change_node_status() function).

       The most prominent example of this is when we want to run a
       certain job again, that is achieved with:

           job_queue_node_change_status( queue , node , JOB_QUEUE_WAITING );

       When the queue manager subsequently finds the job with status
       'JOB_QUEUE_WAITING' it will (re)submit this job.

   the following:

    1. This struct is purely static - i.e. it is invisible outside of
       this file-scope.

    2. Typically the driver would like to store some additional
       information, i.e. the PID of the running process for the local
       driver; that is stored in a (driver specific) struct under the
       field job_data.

    3. If the driver detects that a job has failed it leaves an EXIT
